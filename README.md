# Mire Bot

This repository contains a bot for a custom-modified version of the game **Mire**. The bot automatically connects to the game server, parses room descriptions, collects items, completes quests, and navigates through the game world.

The original Mire game can be found here: [ClojureMire-Updated_Test](https://github.com/gltexture/ClojureMire-Updated_Test).

## Features

- Parses room exits, items, and quests from server messages  
- Executes predefined steps including moving, grabbing items, and using objects  
- Handles quests and item usage automatically  
- Manages connection and message flow reliably  

## Usage

Run the bot and it will connect to your Mire server, interpret messages, and perform actions autonomously according to the predefined steps.
